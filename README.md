### Comparing Two Population Variances: Independent Sampling
In Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine (Dec. 2007), a study of honey as a children’s cough remedy was conducted in which 68 children were randomly assigned to receive either a cold medicine (DM group, n=33) or honey (H group, n=35). Cough improvement scores were recorded for the two groups. Researchers wanted to know if the variability in coughing improvement scores differed between the two groups.

### Conditions Required for Valid Inferences about ( σ^2(1) / σ^2(2) ) 
1. The samples are random and independent.
2. Both populations are normally distributed.

From the informations given, our samples are independent since the children were randomly assigned to the two different groups. We will assume that the 68 children were randomly selected for this project.

Checking the normal probability plots, we will assume the populations are about normally distributed. If we have doubts about the normality of the populations, we could always opt for a nonparametric method like Levene's Test.
